# Speaker

### Critical

- You must be sure how much time you have before the presentation.
- 33% of your time will be spent in the question-answer section. You should calculate this time for your presentation.
- You must have your own converter for projector.
- You should consider time which you will spend on each page of your presentation.
- Preparing a presentation is not an easy task. You shouldn't forget that you cannot prepare a perfect presentation the night before.
- Even if the speaker before you exceeded the time, you will not have a right to exceed the time. 
- When you show codes, dark backgrounds can be a problem. White backgrounds and big font sizes are prefered.

### Important

- Don't trust someone who says they have a converter, bring your own.
- You should have a backup of your presentation on different platforms such as a local disk, a flash disk and on the internet.
- Don't trust the public Wi-fi. You should carry your own mobile connection.
- Don't use time breaks before your presentation to prepare your setup.
- You should share your preferences for questions for example only question at the end.
- Don't use dark backgrounds on your slides. If it is possible, you should use white backgrounds and black font colors.
- Your slides shouldn't have long texts. Don't forget, people want to listen you.
- You should practice before the day of the presentation and understand ways you can improve.
- Don't forget that you will be using the time of other speakers when you talk over your time slot.
- You must know how to connect your device and projector before the presentation.
- Don't talk when you turn your back to participants.
- Participants don't show reactions usually. But this doesn't mean they don't understand anything. Don't talk the about same thing over and over again.


### Development 

- You are not a teacher and the presentations are not a lesson. 
- You don't have to speak about everything.
- You don't have to speak in detail.
- You should try to speak using keywords.
- If it is possible, you should test the connection between your device and the projector at the start of the day.
- If it is possible, you should wear a watch.
- Your presentation has to show all of your slides.
- You can prepare alternative slides to use in different situations.
- You can add estimated time to every slide page.
- You can add external links to topics in case you don't have time to talk about it.
- You might add QR Codes on your slide to access online information.
- If you write a blog before the presentation, that will be beneficial.
- Don't apologize for your bad time management. You should try to improve your skills.
- Before the presentation, you should decide on the perfect stage position.
- You can terminate your presentation instead of stealing time of another speakers.
- Live coding is a risk. You may show a video that you have created before.
