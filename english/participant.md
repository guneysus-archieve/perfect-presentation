# Participant

### Critical

- Don't talk with the speaker when you leave the presentation.
- Don't interupt. Or the attention of the speaker can be lost.

### Important

- You must be punctual at time breaks. Nobody will respect you when you enter the presentation room in middle of a speech.
- Your cell phone's sound must be off. You should check it when the speaker introduces himself. 
- If you will ask a question, you should consider the speaker's request. They may prefer to answer the questions at the end of the speech.
- Don't stand on the stage to ask question and don't greet the speaker during the presentation. Time breaks are a perfect time to do that. 

### Development

- Don't leave the presentation room if it is not a necessary.
- When you are leaving, don't draw attention to yourself. You should be quiet and respectful.
